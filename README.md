### First iteration of basic ee commands
- create
- info
- show
- list
- update
- delete

Note: This is a the first iteration of the code and logic which can be improved throughout development.
There are no separation of concerns in the sense that the logic of commands and database are in a single file.

A better implementation will be done if this iteration clears the test.
